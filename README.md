# Django CRM Tutorial with Just Django
This project was created for following the YouTube video called **[Getting Started With Django Tutorial // Build a CRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOukA4Qh9QA)** from Just Django channel. There are some differences in folders architecture, Python version and environment set up, due to my preferences, but all features, idea and layout comes from the tutorial. My goal is follow all instructions and at the end contribute with my own ideas, that will be in a file (if I have any different idea to contribute, I'll create the file to note and track the status like "to do", "doing" and "done").

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv, therefore, **ensure that you have pipenv installed in your machine** and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following commands line `pipenv shell` and then `pipenv install`.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with `pipenv shell` command and then, **considering that you are at the same directory of manage.py file**, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
